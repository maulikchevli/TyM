\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
TyM is a software designed for generating and testing various Machine Learning models. It gives you a Machine Learning Model as an output which you can instantly use for prediction. This is the first version of this software, hence this document would specify the requirements of TyM 1.0. All the functionalities that have been implemented are covered in this SRS document.

\section{Document Conventions}
The font used while writing this document is Arial and the size is 12 points. For the functional requirements, the default priority is medium if not specified. No inheritance of any kind takes place among the high level requirements and the detailed requirements.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is primarily intended for developers and project managers who want to use Machine Learning models in their projects but don't have the time to implement them. This document is also for users who want to have a ready made Machine Learning model. The Organization of this document is as follows: Chapter 1 Introduction gives the introduction to this document; Chapter 2 Overall Description gives the high level explanation of the software, its functions and characteristics; Chapter 3 External Interface Requirements will give the information about various interfaces; Chapter 4 System Features will give detailed explanation of the features of the software; Chapter 5 Other Nonfunctional Requirements will give the overview of the Non functional requirements.

\section{Project Scope}
TyM software will enable its users to generate Machine Learning Models without implementing them. With the help of the GUI provided by our software, the user will be able to select the ML model he wants and give the data as input on which he wants to train the ML model on. Our software will give suggestions on whether the data overfit or underfit, will show graphical representations and also give the model which the user can download. TyM is for those users who do not have the time for implementing ML models but want to use one. TyM is also for developers who want to see how a ML model fits on the data without implementing them.

\section{References}
TODO
$<$List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may 
include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements 
specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide 
enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, 
including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.$>$


\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
The software TyM is self contained and has no relation to any existing software whatsoever. This is the first version of the software and hence has been developed from scratch.

\section{Product Functions}
TODO
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
Tym software will be used by two types of users: premium users and normal users. Premium users will have more ML models to choose from and will get more insight. Normal users will have the option to upgrade to premium. Normal users can try out the software and, if they want to, can become premium users.

\section{Operating Environment}
Since our software will be deployed over the web, there are no constraints on hardware and the OS. However, TyM software could be only run on Chrome (version 60 or higher) and Mozilla Firefox (version 56 or higher).

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
Tym Software will work only on Chrome (version 60 or higher) and Mozilla Firefox (version 56 or higher). This software was built using HTML5 and Bootstrap for Frontend and flask for backend. ML libraries like sklearn and tensorflow have been used for implementing Machine Learning models. SQL database has been used for storing the user data and their models. All the Backend part has been implemented in Python language.

\section{User Documentation}
A user manual will be provided with the TyM software. It would contain detailed descriptions of the functionalities of the software, how the user would interact with the software and what additional things are available to the premium users.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
Tym software would be dependent on Machine Learning libraries sklearn and tensorflow provided by Python as we will be using these libraries to implement the ML models. Also, it would be dependent on Flask library for backend purposes.


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
TyM software would provide a GUI so that users could easily navigate and use our software. The SignUp page would contain a form asking the user to fill out username, email and password. The Login page would contain a form with username and password fields. To generate a model, the GUI would consist of a form asking the user to fill out the type of ML model, the name of algorithm, the data etc. The History page would contain the past ML models generated by the user in a tabular format. 

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
Since TyM software would be deployed over the internet, there are no constraints on Hardware as such.

\section{Software Interfaces}
Tym software uses SQL database for storing user data and the data about the ML models for each respective user. It uses sklearn and tensorflow libraries provided by Python for implementing the ML models. Data transfer would occur between the TyM software and the SQL database. The data given by the user will be fed into the functions provided by the ML libraries for implementation. 

\section{Communications Interfaces}
No communication functions are required for this software, so no communication interfaces are there.


\chapter{System Features}


\section{User Registration}

\subsection{Description and Priority}
To use TyM software, the user must register an account. In the Registration page, a form will be provided and the details would be filled by the user. Then, the user will enter the username and password to login through the login page. Then the user would be able to use the features provided by TyM software. This feature would have high priority signup features is essential for any software and they provide authentication and other security measures.

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}

\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
The PC (or Laptop) on which the software is running should have good internet connection. Speed should be about 100 Kbps for the software to function smoothly and for good user experience. Data transfer would occur between the database and the software with high baud rate. The latest version of the Operating System should be installed. The software would function with high efficiency and low failure rate.

\section{Safety Requirements}
To ensure that the users of our software have good user experience and no losses of data occur, TyM software is updated by our developer team regularly. Users, if they encounter any bug while using this software, they can report the bug to us through our feedback form and our developer team would rectify it as as soon as possible. Also users should have strong passwords, consisting of both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. 

\section{Security Requirements}
All the user data and application data are stored in encrypted form so that the data is safe and secure. Passwords are hashed and stored to provide additional security. Even if the system crashes, we have data backups and a good disaster recovery plan.

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
TyM software provides users with simple and advanced features. With our clean and easy to use GUI, the software can be used by both developers and normal users. With additional insights provided by our software for the ML model implemented, users and developers can understand whether the ML model is performing well or not. However, the user should know how to navigate a typical website. Also, the input given by the user should be proper for the ML model to perform well.

\section{Business Rules}
There are two types of user: normal users and premium users. If a user is a premium user, then he would have all ML models to implement. Normal users would have only a few models available to them. Also if you are using a model that is provided by our software in your project, then give a citation to TyM software for the model used in your work.
