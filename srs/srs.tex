\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
TyM is a software designed for generating and testing various Machine Learning models. It gives you a Machine Learning Model as an output which you can instantly use for prediction. This is the first version of this software, hence this document would specify the requirements of TyM 1.0. All the functionalities that have been implemented are covered in this SRS document.

\section{Document Conventions}
The font used while writing this document is Arial and the size is 12 points. For the functional requirements, the default priority is medium if not specified. No inheritance of any kind takes place among the high level requirements and the detailed requirements.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is primarily intended for developers and project managers who want to use Machine Learning models in their projects but don't have the time to implement them. This document is also for users who want to have a ready made Machine Learning model. The Organization of this document is as follows: Chapter 1 Introduction gives the introduction to this document; Chapter 2 Overall Description gives the high level explanation of the software, its functions and characteristics; Chapter 3 External Interface Requirements will give the information about various interfaces; Chapter 4 System Features will give detailed explanation of the features of the software; Chapter 5 Other Nonfunctional Requirements will give the overview of the Non functional requirements.

\section{Project Scope}
TyM software will enable its users to generate Machine Learning Models without implementing them. With the help of the GUI provided by our software, the user will be able to select the ML model he wants and give the data as input on which he wants to train the ML model on. Our software will give suggestions on whether the data overfit or underfit, will show graphical representations and also give the model which the user can download. TyM is for those users who do not have the time for implementing ML models but want to use one. TyM is also for developers who want to see how a ML model fits on the data without implementing them.

\section{References}
TODO
$<$List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may 
include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements 
specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide 
enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, 
including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.$>$


\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
The software TyM is self contained and has no relation to any existing software whatsoever. This is the first version of the software and hence has been developed from scratch.

\section{Product Functions}
TODO
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
Tym software will be used by two types of users: premium users and normal users. Premium users will have more ML models to choose from and will get more insight. Normal users will have the option to upgrade to premium. Normal users can try out the software and, if they want to, can become premium users.

\section{Operating Environment}
Since our software will be deployed over the web, there are no constraints on hardware and the OS. However, TyM software could be only run on Chrome (version 60 or higher) and Mozilla Firefox (version 56 or higher).

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
Tym Software will work only on Chrome (version 60 or higher) and Mozilla Firefox (version 56 or higher). This software was built using HTML5 and Bootstrap for Frontend and flask for backend. ML libraries like sklearn and tensorflow have been used for implementing Machine Learning models. SQL database has been used for storing the user data and their models. All the Backend part has been implemented in Python language.

\section{User Documentation}
A user manual will be provided with the TyM software. It would contain detailed descriptions of the functionalities of the software, how the user would interact with the software and what additional things are available to the premium users.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
Tym software would be dependent on Machine Learning libraries sklearn and tensorflow provided by Python as we will be using these libraries to implement the ML models. Also, it would be dependent on Flask library for backend purposes.


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
TyM software would provide a GUI so that users could easily navigate and use our software. The SignUp page would contain a form asking the user to fill out username, email and password. The Login page would contain a form with username and password fields. To generate a model, the GUI would consist of a form asking the user to fill out the type of ML model, the name of algorithm, the data etc. The History page would contain the past ML models generated by the user in a tabular format. 

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
Since TyM software would be deployed over the internet, there are no constraints on Hardware as such.

\section{Software Interfaces}
Tym software uses SQL database for storing user data and the data about the ML models for each respective user. It uses sklearn and tensorflow libraries provided by Python for implementing the ML models. Data transfer would occur between the TyM software and the SQL database. The data given by the user will be fed into the functions provided by the ML libraries for implementation. 

\section{Communications Interfaces}
No communication functions are required for this software, so no communication interfaces are there.


\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the 
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may 
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, 
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the 
most logical sense for your product.$>$

\section{System Feature 1}
$<$Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few 
words.$>$

\subsection{Description and Priority}
$<$Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of 
High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority 
component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a 
relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).$>$

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
$<$List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the 
behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements 
associated with use cases.$>$

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
$<$Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.  
These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user 
to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case.  
Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or 
invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, 
verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary 
information is not yet available.$>$

$<$Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a 
meaningful tag of some kind.$>$

REQ-1:	REQ-2:

\section{System Feature 2 (and so on)}


\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various 
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the 
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the 
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific 
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual 
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
$<$Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or 
harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or 
actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to 
any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the 
product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be 
satisfied.$>$

\section{Security Requirements}
$<$Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use 
of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define 
any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or 
regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any 
security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.$>$

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be 
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or 
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not 
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional 
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$


\chapter{Other Requirements}
$<$Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might 
include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
a single project in each SRS.$>$

\section{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
diagrams.$>$

\section{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
$<$Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain 
in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.$>$
